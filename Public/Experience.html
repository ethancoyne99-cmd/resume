    <h1>Experience</h1><br />

        <li>Maol Reidh Hotel, Tullycross - Kitchen Porter <br /></li>
        <p>As a kitchen porter, my responsibilities were varied. I was in charge of cleaning the many sizes and styles of plates and cutlery that come with an a-la-carte 4-star hotel kitchen. 
            I also assisted the chefs with basic food preparation, such as peeling vegetables and portioning ingredients. In addition, I was responsible for maintaining a clean and organized kitchen, which included sweeping and mopping the floors, taking out the bins, and cleaning the kitchen equipment.
            My role saw me in charge of closing the kitchen at night, ensuring it was cleaned to meet the standards outlined by current health and safety regulations.
            I would coordinate the kitchen's weekly deep-cleans. <br /></p>
        <li>Portwest Retail Outlet, Galway - Retailer<br /></li>
        <p>Portwest is considered to be an institution on the Irish high street. It is famous for selling workwear and outdoor gear.
            My role as a retailer involved a variety of tasks, including customer service, stock management, and visual merchandising. I was responsible for assisting customers with their purchases, answering any questions they had about the products, and ensuring they had a positive shopping experience.
            In my time at Portwest, I made a name for myself as a top salesman, while we did not have set sales targets I was consistently responsible for some of the highest sales figures across all our retail outlets.
            In order to adequately tailor the shopping experience to each customer, I had to develop a deep understanding of the products we sold. This involved learning about the different types of workwear and outdoor gear, as well as their features and benefits. For example, the different waterproofing levels for outdoor garments. Spoiler alert; GoreTex isn't always the best option.

        <li>Paddy Power, Clifden - Bookmaker</li>
        <p>Paddy Power is a famous gambling institution in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In my time at Paddy Power, I was employed as a bookmaker. My responsibilities included taking and translating bets, as well as handling the transactions.
            On average, my shop saw 400 cash transactions per day. This required me to become proficient in cash handling, namely making change 'on the fly'. Unlike most retail outlets, the ePOS used by bookmakers does not calculate change owed to customers.                 Additionally, I was responsible for balancing the till at the end of each shift. This involved counting the cash in the till several times per day and ensuring that it matched the sales recorded on the ePOS system.
            I was also responsible for maintaining a clean and organized shop, which included cleaning the shop floor, restocking coupons, hanging newspapers, and ensuring that the betting slips were properly organized into their different categories and multiple types.
            As gambling involves a variety of 'multiples', i.e. single transactions involving different combinations of wagers, I had to practice mental calculations daily. This helped me to become proficient in basic arithmetic, as well as more complex calculations involving odds and payouts. While I can't beat a calculator, I certainly became quick at calculations.

        <li>Rowanbeg Design Studios, Clifden - Retailer</li>
        <p>Rowanbeg Design Studios was a design house based in Connemara with a retail store in Clifden. I was the retail store's sole employee. I was some 30 minutes removed from the studio, and therefore worked independently from the company's owner and lead designer.
            My responsibilities included customer service, stock management, and visual merchandising. I was responsible for assisting customers with their purchases, answering any questions they had about the products, and ensuring they had a positive shopping experience.
            I was also responsible for maintaining a clean and organized shop, which included cleaning the shop floor, restocking stock, and ensuring that the products were sale-worthy and displayed.
            In addition to my retail duties, I was also responsible for opening and closing the shop each day. This involved ensuring that the shop was secure at all times, as well as handling both cash and card transactions and balancing the till at the end of each shift.
            As the sole employee of the shop, I had to be self-motivated and able to work independently. This required me to develop strong time management skills, as well as the ability to prioritize tasks effectively.
