        <li>Pobailscoil na nClochán (4 years), Yeats College (1 year) - Leaving Certificate<br /></li>
        <p>I completed my Leaving Certificate in 2018, achieving a final score of 531, through a combination of 1 H1, 2 H2s, and 3 H3s. My subjects included English, Maths, French, Business, Physics and Chemistry as a single subject (once called PhysChem, no longer offered), and Design and Communication Graphics (technical drawing and 3d modelling).
            I also completed a number of extracurricular activities during my time at Pobailscoil na nClochán. I was a member of the school's choir, which won several competitions at both the local and national level. I was also a founding member and head of logistics for the school's rock band, which put on several charity concerts during my time at the school.
        In addition to my academic and extracurricular achievements, I also completed a number of work experience placements during my time at Pobailscoil na nClochán. These placements took place at a local computer repair store and the local radio station.

        <li>University College Cork - Batchellors of Art and Science B.A.S. Architecture</li>
        <p>I began my undergraduate degree in Architecture at University College Cork in 2018. My degree was a four-year program that combined both art and science, with a focus on the built environment.
            During my time at UCC, I completed a number of design projects, both individually and as part of a team. These projects ranged from small-scale residential designs to large-scale urban planning projects. I also completed a number of technical courses, including structural engineering, building services, and construction management.
            In addition to my academic achievements, I also completed a number of extracurricular activities during my time at UCC. I was a member of the university's architecture society, which organized a number of events and trips throughout the year. 
            Unfortunately, I did not complete my degree, as the university stopped offering my desired specialisation, conservation, as a course of study at the end of my first year. I decided to leave the program and pursue other opportunities.

        <li>University of Galway - Batchellors of Science B.S. Mechanical Engineering</li>
        <p>In 2019, I began my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at University of Galway. My degree was a four-year program based around the study of mechanical engineering. 
            During my time at the University of Galway, I completed a number of design projects, both individually and as part of a team. These projects ranged from small-scale conceptual designs to larger-scale engineering projects. I also completed a number of technical courses, including thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and materials science.
            I did not undertake any extracurricular activities during my time in the university, as Covid-19 had moved all learning activities online. This made it difficult to participate in any extracurricular activities, as most of them were cancelled due to their in-person nature.
            I did not complete my studies in Mechanical Engineering, as I found that the course was not a good fit for me. Additionally, I found the transition back to in-person lectures to be jarring and difficult. I decided to leave the program in my third year and pursue other opportunities.
        </p>
        <hr/>
    <p>Although I did not complete either of my undergraduate degrees, I did learn a lot from both programs. I developed a strong foundation in both art and science, as well as a number of technical skills that will be useful in my future career.
    I have spent the time since leaving university working in a number of different roles, as outlined above. I have also been working on a number of personal projects, including learning new skills such as web development and classical philosophy. 
    I spend a lot of my free time on Udemy, learning new skills and expanding my knowledge. </p>
